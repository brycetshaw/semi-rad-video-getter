# semi-rad-video-getter

This is a script that downloads all "Friday Inspiration" videos posted on semi-rad.com.
The videos are 3 to 22 minutes long, and tend to have an inspirational bent to them.
If allowed to run long enough, this will download 200 videos for a total of 292 gb. 

- If you do not have 292 gb free, you can delete some urls from the .txt file
- You do not need to run the python script, it just populates the .txt file, which is already populated.
- you can add other urls to the .txt file and they might download. 

- You must have youtube-dl installed for this to work. It's pretty neat, I reccomend it.
